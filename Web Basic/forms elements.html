        <p> Pets are a great blessing in anyone's life.They are the only ones who love us unconditionally. Pets always offer us everything they have without asking for anything in return. </p>
        <p> This is how the relationship between pets is evolving. People treat them no less than humans. For instance, they celebrate their birthdays; get those matching outfits and more. </p>

            <p> My father adopted Sasha when he was a little baby. His friend had given birth to puppies and they decided to put the puppies up for adoption. We convinced our father to get one for us. Considering they knew our family well, they immediately agreed. Little did we know that our lives would change forever after his entrance. </p>
